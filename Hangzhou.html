    <h1>Street-network Sprawl in Hangzhou</h1>
    <section id="intro">
      <h3>What is Street-network sprawl?</h3>
      <p>Street-network Sprawl is a way to measure urban sprawl, worldwide, through the connectedness of the streets. 
            Less sprawl means more connected, more walkable streets.
            Well-connected streets – like New York City’s grid – are more walkable and can be served by public transit.
            </p>
      <p>The street network is permanent, and its connectivity affects the livability and environmental footprint of cities for decades and centuries to come. 
            In places with more connected streets, residents drive less and walk more. 
            Sprawl is associated with worse outcomes for health, the environment, overconsumption, social segregation, and equity.
            </p>
      <h3>SNDi -- our measure of “sprawl” (disconnectedness)</h3>
      <p>Our measure for street-network sprawl is the sprawl index, or the SNDi (Street Network Disconnectedness Index).The SNDi captures: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>nodal degree</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>dendricity</i>, the tree-likeness of the street network
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>circuity</i>, the ratio of the distance by road to the straight-line distance of two locations on the street network
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>sinuosity</i>, the curviness of a street
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>A higher SNDi means less-connected streets – i.e., more sprawl.</p>

          <b>Most recent snapshot: </b>Taking into account all of the streets constructed in Hangzhou up till 2014, the overall level of street network sprawl is 1.79. The SNDi ranges from a score of 0 (high connectivity), to ?? (high disconnectivity). With an SNDi of 1.79, the street network in Hangzhou is relatively well-connected. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Trends in street network construction: </b>In &lt;1975, the SNDi was 1.19. In 1976-1990, the SNDi was 2.0. In 1991-2000, the SNDi was 1.94. In 2001-2014, the SNDi was 2.01. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Effect on the aggregate network: </b>Overall, this leads to a rise in cumulative disconnectivity: since 1975, the city has become more disconnected.
