    <h1>Street-network Sprawl in Montreal</h1>
    <section id="intro">
      <h3>What is Street-network sprawl?</h3>
      <p>Street-network Sprawl is a way to measure urban sprawl, worldwide, through the connectedness of the streets. 
            Less sprawl means more connected, more walkable streets.
            Well-connected streets – like New York City’s grid – are more walkable and can be served by public transit.
            </p>
      <p>The street network is permanent, and its connectivity affects the livability and environmental footprint of cities for decades and centuries to come. 
            In places with more connected streets, residents drive less and walk more. 
            Sprawl is associated with worse outcomes for health, the environment, overconsumption, social segregation, and equity.
            </p>
      <h3>SNDi -- our measure of “sprawl” (disconnectedness)</h3>
      <p>Our measure for street-network sprawl is the sprawl index, or the SNDi (Street Network Disconnectedness Index).The SNDi captures: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>nodal degree</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>dendricity</i>, the tree-likeness of the street network
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>circuity</i>, the ratio of the distance by road to the straight-line distance of two locations on the street network
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>sinuosity</i>, the curviness of a street
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>A higher SNDi means less-connected streets – i.e., more sprawl.</p>

          <b>Currently: </b>Taking into account all of the streets constructed in Montreal up till 2014, the overall level of street network sprawl is 1.81. The SNDi ranges from a score of 0 (high connectivity), to ?? (high disconnectivity). With an SNDi of 1.81, the street network in Montreal is relatively well-connected. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Street construction in each period: </b>In each period, new street development is more disconnected than in the last. This increase has slowed: between &lt;1975 and 1976-1990, SNDi rose by 1.4 points, but between 1991-2000 and 2001-2014, it rose by just 0.54. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Street network sprawl in the city: </b>Overall, this leads to a rise in cumulative disconnectivity: since 1975, the city has become more disconnected.

          <p>Since 1975, the region has become more disconnected. The total level of street network sprawl in Montreal is lower than the regional level. The level of disconnectivity in new street development in Montreal follows the same trend as Québec. </p>
          <p>To date, Montreal is the 7th-most disconnected city out of the 9 cities in Québec. It has maintained its place in the ranks since 1975. In &lt;1975, it ranked 7th, ranked 6th in 1976-1990 and ranked 7th in 1991-2000 and ranked 6th in 2001-2014. </p>
          <p>In Canada, new street layouts initially increased in disconnectivity, until the peak in 1991-2000. Compared to Canada, the level of disconnectivity in Montreal is lower overall. The level of disconnectivity in new street development in Montreal does not follow the national trend. Between 1991-2000 and 2001-2014, national SNDi was decreasing instead. </p>
