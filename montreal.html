    <h1>Street-network Sprawl in Montreal</h1>
    <div id="intro">
      <h3>What is Street-network sprawl?</h3>
      <p>Street-network Sprawl is a way to measure urban sprawl, worldwide, through the connectedness of the streets. Less sprawl means more connected, more walkable streets.


Well-connected streets – like New York City’s grid – are more walkable and can be served by public transit.


Our measure for street-network sprawl is the sprawl index, or the SNDi (Street Network Disconnectedness Index). A higher SNDi means less-connected streets – i.e., more sprawl.

    
The street network is permanent, and its connectivity affects the livability and environmental footprint of cities for decades and centuries to come. In places with more connected streets, residents drive less and walk more. Sprawl is associated with worse outcomes for health, the environment, overconsumption, social segregation, and equity.

        <p>overall trend: Over time, street networks in Montreal have become more disconnected.</p>
        <p>shape of incremental trend: In each period, new street development is more disconnected than the last.</p>
        <p>shape of cumualative trend: Overall, this leads to a slight rise in cumulative disconnectivity: since 1975, the city has become more disconnected.</p>

        <p>regional trend: New street development in each period in the region has increased in disconnectivity over time.</p>
        <p>compare to regional: The levels of street disconnectivity in Montreal and Québec are both rising.</p>
        <p>regional ranking: (old text)To date, Montreal is the 7th-most disconnected city out of the 9 cities in Québec. It has maintained its place in the ranks since 1975. In &lt;1975, it ranked 7th, ranked 6th in 1976-1990 and ranked 7th in 1991-2000 and ranked 6th in 2001-2014. </p>
        <p>national trend: In Canada, street network disconnectivity steadily rises until 2000, after which there is a small decrease.</p>
        <p>compare to national: This is unlike Montreal, where developers from 2001-2014 have built more disconnected streets instead.</p>

        <p>regional trend: The region has become more disconnected over time.</p>
        <p>compare to regional: Montreal has become more disconnected too, but the overall level of SNDi is still lower than the regional level.</p>
        <p>regional ranking: (old text)To date, Montreal is the 7th-most disconnected city out of the 9 cities in Québec. It has maintained its place in the ranks since 1975. In &lt;1975, it ranked 7th, and remained in this position since.</p>
        <p>national trend: The country has also become more disconnected over time.</p>
        <p>compare to national: It is more disconnected than Québec or Montreal.</p>
