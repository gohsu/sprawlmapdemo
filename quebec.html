    <h1>Street-network Sprawl in Québec</h1>
    <section id="intro">
      <h3>What is Street-network sprawl?</h3>
      <p>Street-network Sprawl is a way to measure urban sprawl, worldwide, through the connectedness of the streets. 
            Less sprawl means more connected, more walkable streets.
            Well-connected streets – like New York City’s grid – are more walkable and can be served by public transit.
            </p>
      <p>The street network is permanent, and its connectivity affects the livability and environmental footprint of cities for decades and centuries to come. 
            In places with more connected streets, residents drive less and walk more. 
            Sprawl is associated with worse outcomes for health, the environment, overconsumption, social segregation, and equity.
            </p>
      <h3>SNDi -- our measure of “sprawl” (disconnectedness)</h3>
      <p>Our measure for street-network sprawl is the sprawl index, or the SNDi (Street Network Disconnectedness Index).The SNDi captures: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>nodal degree</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>dendricity</i>, the tree-likeness of the street network
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>circuity</i>, the ratio of the distance by road to the straight-line distance of two locations on the street network
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>sinuosity</i>, the curviness of a street
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>A higher SNDi means less-connected streets – i.e., more sprawl.</p>

          <b>Trends in street network construction: </b>Taking into account all roads in Québec, the overall level of street network sprawl is 2.59. New street construction in Québec has been increasing in disconnectivity over time. This increase has slowed: between &lt;1975 and 1976-1990, SNDi rose by 1.35 points, but between 1991-2000 and 2001-2014, it rose by just 0.48.
